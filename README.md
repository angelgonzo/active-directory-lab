Hi, this is the repo I'll use to show case my Active Directory lab.

Here I'll document the set up of the Active Directory
- Local Server
- Server Clusters
- Roles
- Networks

I want to learn how to use Active Directory because Windows is still one of the most used OS across the market, making this skill very valuable to have even at a basic level.
As well, as being able to apply this to a System Admins role, something that I've been interested in a long time.

Understanding how to use the UI can also help me understand how all the settings work and I can eventually transition to learning Active Directory in a headless environment which is also a extra skillset one could have.

I'm excited to see how this differs from Linux.

I'll be using Windows Server 2025 on a VM running on 2 CPU cores, with 5 GB of Memory.
